This is my first calculator. Nothing fancy. Just a simple calculator.

...still a work in progress, fixing things one at a time.

Things to fix:
1. Floating point numbers
2. After equals, if user does not choose an operator, things must reset.

Things to add
1. Negation
2. Percent
3. Usable even with keypresses
